These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, the first urban culture in South Asia, which flourished during 2500â€“1900 BCE in modern day Pakistan and western India. Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade. Ancient India was one of the four Old World cradles of civilization."
