And at the beginning of this 2025, that is, in the first week of February, Saraswati Puja will be celebrated in the worship of the Tiger Goddess. The entire Tilottama Saraswati Puja is celebrated in words. We say that Bengali Valentine's Day. Anyway, I will come later. Anyway, this time I am saying that it is a surprise, Saraswati Puja, but there is a big surprise in Batanagar. Yes guys, you heard me right, in Maheshtala, to know this surprise, you have to watch the entire video from the beginning to the end. If you are new to the channel, subscribe to the channel. Let's start the video without further ado. So guys, I am right now at Batanagar Newland Ground. Batanagar Newland Puja Committee is right in front of me. One of the big pujas in the district is being held. This is Batta Newland Puja Committee. This Newland Puja Committee gives us new themes every year. If we go back to 2024, in 2024, but the theme that was given to us was like the Akshardham Temple in Delhi, but it gave us a theme. This Newland Puja Committee is just a part of the charm, as we see every year, the fair is held here. You can see this ground here. But as we see every year, the fair is held here. This ground is a big surprise. This year, 2025, Saraswati Puja is going on. Yes guys, that's right. You heard that we are going to see the 111-foot Mother Statue in Batanagar Newland. Yes, let's show you the whole thing. Let's show you the whole thing very quickly. The banner that has been unveiled is the Biggest Saraswati in Batanagar. Bani Archana 2025. Head bowed to the mother. Is Batanagar's Saraswati really the tallest of all? We are going to see the 111-foot Mother Statue. Yes, guys, you are absolutely right. We are going to see the 111-foot Mother Statue for the first time in Batanagar Newland. It is being organized by Kara Creation and Batanagar Square and invited by Gopal Saha. So, this time, let's show you some moments of preparation. So, guys, let's slowly enter the inner part and you can see the inside. It is already ready, but the theme work has started because there is only a few days left. After that, Saraswati Puja and you can see a huge place, but the complete theme work is being done all around. If you can see it completely but with such tin but the whole thing is surrounded. If you can see the main part, if you can see the bamboo bakery, that bakery is brought in a lot. Also, if you can see a lot of bamboo scattered around, that's because the work of making the structure has just started. If you can see different angles of iron have been brought throughout this part, that is to say, along with bamboo, iron is also used throughout the entire mandap. Now let's go around the entire mandap. If you can see this part, you can see an iron structure being made, quite large, and this structure is being thrown, but I can see that the bamboo back is also being used, that is, this will be installed in a few days. And this time I come to the main part of the mandap. If you can see a lot of bamboo scattered around, since without bamboo, the mandap It is said to be impossible to erect because bamboo is the main part of erecting the mandap and this is the mandap itself. You can see it slowly but it is being prepared. The 111- foot mother idol in Batanagar is going to be a world record. If you look at the heart of Batanagar, you can see the fish of the pole worship that was held, and with it, there are crores of worship items. The initial stage of preparation work has started slowly. There is a big surprise in the heart of Batanagar, but this year, the creation of the Batanagar Maheshtala and the Batanagar Square, which are going to be a gift to you, I don't think it has been talked about before. And this year, who is coming to Batanagar to see this mother idol? Obviously, but let me know by commenting. So guys, this is the initial stage of the work of creating the structure, which I have presented to you at this moment, nothing more than this is being shown at this moment. I will keep updating you all, so guys, before ending the video, let me tell you how exactly you can come to Batanagar Newland Ground to see the 111-foot Maa Saraswati. Yes, if you come from Sealdah, I think the railway will be the most convenient because if you take the Bajbabali local from Sealdah, you will have to get down at Nungi station, and from Nungi station, you will have to walk a little, then you will reach Batanagar Newland Ground. Also, if you come from Howrah, there is a Bata mini to come directly to Batagar. If you take that mini, then you will have to get down under Bata bridge, but you will reach Batanagar Newland Ground. Also, if you come from Dharmatala, there is a special bus number 77 to come to Batagar from Dharmatala. If you take that bus, but you will get down under Bata Vurdha. You will come very easily. You can see the 111 ft. Mother Statue in Batanagar, but you can see it very easily. Anyway, I'm ending today's video here. I'm watching another blog video. Keep watching the chat in Kolkata.
